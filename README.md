# Introduction

Specgen allows developers to write specification of HTTP API and/or JSON models.

Specgen provides good quality code generation for HTTP service, client and models code. This is full implementation of API-first approach. API creation/changes happens first in the formal API specification and then these changes automatically reflected in the code.

The documentation is split into following sections:

[spec](#spec/format.md) describes spec format language

[specgen](#spec/format.md) describes code generation features
